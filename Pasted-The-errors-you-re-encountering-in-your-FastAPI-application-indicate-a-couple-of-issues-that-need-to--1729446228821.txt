The errors you're encountering in your FastAPI application indicate a couple of issues that need to be addressed. Let's break down the key errors and provide solutions for each.

1. TypeError: object list can't be used in 'await' expression
This error occurs when you try to use await on a function that returns a regular list instead of an awaitable (like a coroutine).

Solution:
Check the get_chat_history and get_video_analysis_history functions in your code. If these functions are returning a list directly, you should not use await on them. Instead, you can either:

Remove the await if the function is synchronous and returns a list.
Ensure that the function is defined as an asynchronous function (using async def) and returns an awaitable.
For example, if your function looks like this:

def get_chat_history (user_id):# 
SOME
 logic 
TO
 
get
 chat history 
RETURN
 chat_history_list # This 
IS
 a list
You should change it to:

async def get_chat_history (user_id):# 
SOME
 logic 
TO
 
get
 chat history 
RETURN
 chat_history_list # This should be an awaitable
2. Foreign Key Constraint Violation
The error message indicates that you are trying to insert a record into the user_chat_history table with a user_id that does not exist in the users table. The specific error is:

Key (user_id)
=
(
3e060
bb1
-793
c
-49
ad
-
a9dd
-516
a95a8c911) 
is
 
not
 present 
in
 
table
 "users".
Solution:
Check User Existence: Before inserting a record into user_chat_history, ensure that the user_id exists in the users table. You can do this by querying the users table to see if the user exists.

Insert User First: If the user does not exist, you need to create the user first before inserting chat history.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might check for the user:

async def insert_chat_message(user_id, message, chat_type):
    # 
Check
 if 
user
 
exists

    user_exists 
=
 await check_user_exists(user_id)  # Implement this 
function

    if 
not
 user_exists:
        raise ValueError("User does not exist")
    # Proceed 
with
 the 
insert

    await db.table("user_chat_history").
insert
({
        "user_id": user_id,
        "message": message,
        "chat_type": chat_type
    }).
execute
()
Summary of Steps to Fix:
Review and Update Functions: Ensure that get_chat_history and get_video_analysis_history are correctly defined as asynchronous functions if they are meant to be awaited.
Check User Existence: Before inserting into user_chat_history, check if the user exists in the users table.
Handle Errors Gracefully: Implement error handling to manage cases where the user does not exist.
